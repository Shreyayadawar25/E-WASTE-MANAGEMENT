                <P>E-waste is a term used to cover various forms of electrical and electronic equipment. Whether a new
                    or an old
                    item, it’s still trashing if the owner doesn’t use it for other uses.

                    This has even become a global pandemic, mainly because of the use that increases the toxicity over
                    time. Both
                    human health and the environment are at risk, so each category of waste like this needs to be
                    handled
                    immediately.</P>

        <h2>7 Types of Electronic Waste with Its Each Definition</h2>
        <p>You can’t ignore the fact that there is a lot of waste worldwide, and the amount is unstoppable. But if you
            see
            the amount of waste that has increased the most, it is electronic waste. For garbage like this, it is
            usually
            divided into these seven types:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>ICT and Telecommunications Equipment</h3>
                <p>Items classified into ICT include CPUs, screens, monitors, mice, printers, keyboards, networking
                    equipment, laptops, audio amplifiers, CDs, DVDs, and video cameras. And this number is arguably the
                    most
                    in the current era because it is the easiest to obtain.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Office Electronics</h3>
                <p>Office use and the amount of trash in the world seem to be a problem. Office electronics include
                    calculators, photocopying equipment, electronical, typewriters, telephones, fax machines, and
                    facsimiles
                    if they are still in the office.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3> Large Household Appliances</h3>
                <P>Let’s see first what electronic items are in large sizes in your home. You could say everyday items
                    such
                    as freezers, cookers, air conditioners, radiators, fans, and many more. And it is classified as
                    electronic waste in a large size.</P>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Small Household Appliances</h3>
                <p>If it was a large one, now try to imagine small items also included in electronic devices. These are
                    things like hair dryers, fryers, swing weaving, and many more. And this also consists of a lot.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Consumer Equipment</h3>
                <P>Items used for consumer use will also be included in the electronic waste sector. This category for
                    consumers is all forms of activity that will be important to serve consumers. Many activities fall
                    into
                    this category.</P>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Medical Equipment</h3>
                <P>And there are still many who are not aware that this waste is also included in medical matters. If
                    this
                    is added up, it can be calculated how much the amount of waste is. So, electronic equipment is
                    involved
                    in injury, treatment, prevention, and detection activities.</P>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Toys Leisure and Sports Equipment</h3>
                <P>As kids grow older, of course, there are toys or games that they no longer use. And there must be
                    some of
                    those items that belong to electronics. If there is only one electronic component, such as a
                    battery, in
                    the toy, then it is classified as e-waste as well.

                    The problems in our homes are not only in the security sector but also related to environmental
                    issues.
                    Garbage, which is increasing over time, has become the most common issue today. And you see a lot
                    about
                    the types of electronic waste circulating.</P>
