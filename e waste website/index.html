                <h1><u>WHAT IS E-WASTE?</u></h1>
                <p>E-waste is a popular, informal name for electronic products nearing the end of their “useful life.”
                    Computers,
                    televisions, VCRs, stereos, copiers, and fax machines are common electronic products. Many of these
                    products can
                    be reused, refurbished, or recycled.</p>

                <p> With the passage of the <a href="act.html"> Waste Recycling Act of 2003</a>, certain portions of the
                    electronic
                    waste stream are defined and the systems to recover and recycle them will be administratively
                    regulated
                    beyond
                    the universal waste rules that apply to material handling. Please refer to our regulatory
                    information
                    section
                    for updates on laws, regulations, and policies affecting e-waste management, and our Covered
                    Electronic
                    Waste

                <h1><u>E-Waste FAQs</u></h1>
                <h3>Is “e-waste” clearly defined?</h3>
                <p>The term “e-waste” is loosely applied to consumer and business electronic equipment that is near or
                    at
                    the end of
                    its useful life. There is no clear definition for e-waste; for instance whether or not items like
                    microwave
                    ovens and other similar “appliances” should be grouped into the category has not been established.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Is “e-waste” considered hazardous?</h3>
                <P>Certain components of some electronic products contain materials that render them hazardous,
                    depending on
                    their
                    condition and density. For instance, California law currently views nonfunctioning cathode ray tubes
                    (CRT) from
                    televisions and monitors as hazardous.</P>
                <br>
                <h3>What should I do with my electronic discards?</h3>
                <P>The mantra of<b>“Reduce, Reuse, Recycle”</b> applies here.</P>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reduce </strong>your generation of e-waste through smart procurement and good
                        maintenance.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Reuse</strong> still functioning electronic equipment by donating or selling it to
                        someone
                        who can
                        still use it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recycle</strong> those products that cannot be repaired. Computer monitors, televisions
                        and
                        other
                        electronic equipment should NOT be disposed of with regular garbage, as this is illegal in
                        California.</li>
